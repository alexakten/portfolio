    title: "making medicine, not vitamins.",
    date: "Jan 7, 2024",
    content: `Creating solutions for problems that don't even exist is tempting. That's how most of my ideas come about. "Wouldn't it be fun if there was an app that did [fill in the blank]?". This thought strikes me probably ten times a day. But I have to remind myself to resist the temptation to dive deeper into the thought. Because most likely, the idea is pretty shit and no one would be interested in paying for an app that did [fill in the blank]. 
    
    I am working hard on reprogramming my mind to see problems, instead of fun app ideas. Sure, there are tons of fun apps out there. But if I want to build something that actually makes life better for people, I have to solve real problems. I have to create the medicine to their pain, not just give them vitamin gummy bears.

    title: "i might've found a startup idea.",
    date: "Jan 3, 2024",
    content: `Finding the perfect startup idea has seemed so impossible for me. Like all indie hackers, I've wanted to find something that I can build once and work on maintaining. But that is probably impossible. Is that even what I want? The fun comes from building new stuff. I'm scared that I will get tired of committing to one idea, like I've become so many times before. I feel like I usually start a project so excited, and when it comes time to actually build hard stuff I get bored and start second guessing my idea. 

    But now, I might've find something that I'm truly excited to build. And no, it's not another project manager. It's not a shitty to-do list app. It's a problem that is difficult enough that I yet have no idea how to really solve.  And that is exciting to me. It's not just copying someone else's idea either, like I've done with many of my previous projects. It's a space where I truly have to be innovative and learn a lot before I know what to even build. But just contributing to this space somehow is something that really motivates me.
    
    The space is climate tech, and helping reduce deforestation in Brazil. I want to contribute somehow to making not cutting down trees more profitable than using the land for agriculture, which is a big reason for deforestation. If successful, there is a possibility to create a win-win-win situation for landowners, investors (companies emitting gases wanting to offset their emissions), and the planet. This is just an idea for now, but I have to start somewhere.
